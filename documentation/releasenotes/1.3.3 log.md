The biggest release so far.
### Changes
 * **NEW** Added support for multi-protocol, this allows me to add extra implementations in the future.
 * **NEW** Added support for the WebSocket protocol, this means that when you use th Fire-IO.js library you can use Fire-IO in your web-applications. The server will accept the connection like normal, the usual API (channels, messages etc) also apply.
 * **NEW** WebSocket data handling and convertor.
 * **NEW** Version detections and manager. Fire-IO client's will now check a server's version upon connecting, this makes FireIoClients backwards compatible and future proof. This will also prevent mission-critical failures due to protocol mismatches.
 * **NEW** Fire-IO.js, a JavaScript implementation for the Fire-IO client. It's a basic implementation that currently only support's Strings but other data (like Objects and Streams) will be added in the future.
 
### Fixes
 * **NEW** `Client#getConnectionType()` to check if the client is the usual Java client or a web-connection.
 * **FIX** Fixed an important security issue with pre-connection authentication.
 
### Improvements
 * **IMPROVEMENT** Minor code improvements.
